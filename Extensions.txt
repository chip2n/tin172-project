Proposed extensions to the AI

- Ability to ask control questions
- Find best (shortest) solution
- Qualifiers: any, a, the, all
- Adding "not" modifier (Pick up any ball NOT beside a table)
- Utterance for flip (bottom-most object becomes top in a column).
- Utterance for swap (swap any two objects, keeping all others in the same final position).
- Add/Remove objects?
