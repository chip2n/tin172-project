\section*{Background}
The group decided to work with an agile workflow and to use git for versioning.
With this kind of workflow did the work focus on the one utterance at a time.
This helped the group to work in different part of the code without conflicts.

As of now the assumptions the group have made about the problems that could
occur are only two problems so far. Firstly an utterance asking to pick up the
floor would evaluate to an empty list of goals since the floor has a fixed
position.

Secondly the utterance requesting to take (pick up) multiple objects
without some secondary objective (such as putting them all in boxes) will be
impossible since we cannot hold more than a single object at a time.

\section*{Extensions}
\begin{itemize}
\item Ambiguity resolution by asking follow-up questions, eg. ` Did you mean the blue or the red ball?`
\item A `switch' utterance, to let the user switch place of two objects while the rest of the world remains the same
\item Find the shortest/best solution by some measure
\item Implement negation for objects, eg. `The non-white ball', and for relations, eg. `A ball which is not on the floor'.
\item Support for the different quantifiers, `a', `any', `the', `all'.
\end{itemize}
