% 1. Introduction
% - Foundation of the world
%   (how spatial relations are interpreted
%    how goals are seperated)

% 2. Interpretation
% - How are parse trees connected to PDDLs
%   how objects identified in the world
%   what happens when there are multiple objects matching the description?
%   Quantifier handling: the/any/all.

% 3. Ambiguity resolution
% - How are multiple PDDL goals handled? pick first/random? clarification
%   question? return ambiguity error.

% 4. Planning
% - Desception of search algorithm
% - Heuristics used
% - Cost function (what is being minimized? - arm movement, number of steps
% - Average call complexity (lower & upper bounds)
% - data structures used to represent world, goal search space

% 5. Miscellaneous uretionalistics(?)

% 6. Literal use survey

% not naturel language, but controlled naturel language.
% No programming language terms
% - Software development terms can be used
%   Examples: (FIGURE/FLOWCHART)
% -> utterance -> parse tree -> PDDL goals -A-> PDDL goal -P-> actions
% Pseudo code snippets
% use template provided
% individual contibutions
% 8 pages + appendix/references

\section*{Introdction}
\begin{description}
  \item[Beside] The assumption here was that the two objects should be placed in
    two columns that are located next to eachother.
  \item[Leftof] We interpreted this to be that the first object would have to be
    placed in one of the columns that are left of the right objects column and
    vice versa.
  \item[Rightof] Just as in \verb|Leftof|, but the two objects are flipped.
  \item[Above] This was interpreted to mean that the two objects would be placed
    in the same column with the first object being above the second one, but
    there could exist objects between them.
  \item[Ontop] We took this to mean that the first object needed to be placed
   strictly on the second object with no objects in between them.
  \item[Under] This was interpreted just as \verb|Above|, but the two objects
    were flipped.
  \item[Inside] We assumed this relation could only be applied to boxes, but
  otherwise it follows the \verb|Ontop| relation.

% The group decided to work with an agile workflow and to use git for versioning.
% With this kind of workflow did the work focus on the one utterance at a time.
% This helped the group to work in different part of the code without conflicts.

% As of now the assumptions the group have made about the problems that could
% occur are only two problems so far. Firstly an utterance asking to pick up the
% floor would evaluate to an empty list of goals since the floor has a fixed
% position.

% Secondly the utterance requesting to take (pick up) multiple objects
% without some secondary objective (such as putting them all in boxes) will be
% impossible since we cannot hold more than a single object at a time.

\section*{Extensions}
\begin{itemize}
\item Ambiguity resolution by asking follow-up questions, eg. ` Did you mean the blue or the red ball?`
\item A `switch' utterance, to let the user switch place of two objects while the rest of the world remains the same
\item Find the shortest/best solution by some measure
\item Implement negation for objects, eg. `The non-white ball', and for relations, eg. `A ball which is not on the floor'.
\item Support for the different quantifiers, `a', `any', `the', `all'. \cite{APath}
