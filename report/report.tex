\section*{Background}
The group decided to work with an agile workflow and to use git for versioning.
With this kind of workflow did the work focus on the one utterance at a time.
This helped the group to work in different part of the code without conflicts.

As of now the assumptions the group have made about the problems that could
occur are only two problems so far. Firstly an utterance asking to pick up the
floor would evaluate to an empty list of goals since the floor has a fixed
position.

Secondly the utterance requesting to take (pick up) multiple objects
without some secondary objective (such as putting them all in boxes) will be
impossible since we cannot hold more than a single object at a time.

\section*{Parser}
%Refactored the project and added a test which currently fails // Andreas
%instance Eq Size instead of deriving
The group started of by creating instances for Eq-class for the different types
such as Size, Color and Form. This was done to add the possiblity for the value
any- size, color or form and also to simplify the search process.
%The parser is currently unchanged. We intend to extend it with the negation
%command as mentioned below.

\section*{Interpreter}
The interpreter will be working with the world to find objects that match the
criteria such that the planner only works with the objects id and not the
objects description.

\section*{Ambiguity resolver}
The current ambiguity resolver i very simple. It just checks the number of
possible interpretations. If we only have one it passes it through, otherwise
it simply rejects the command.

\section*{Planner}
The planner is basically untouched as of yet. We have been working mostly on
the interpreter and ambiguity resolver. It can currently only partially execute
the take command. It can find the correct column where the requested object
lies but only picks up the top object in that column.


\section*{Extensions}
\begin{itemize}
\item Ambiguity resolution by asking follow-up questions, eg. ` Did you mean the blue or the red ball?`
\item A `switch' utterance, to let the user switch place of two objects while the rest of the world remains the same
\item Find the shortest/best solution by some measure
\item Implement negation for objects, eg. `The non-white ball', and for relations, eg. `A ball which is not on the floor'.
\item Support for the different quantifiers, `a', `any', `the', `all'.
\end{itemize}
