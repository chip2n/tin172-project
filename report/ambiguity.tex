\section*{Ambiguity resolver}
The ambiguity resolver needs the state of the world and all the possible goals that could be interpreted from the input.
Once we have the goals we checks all of them if the laws of physics will apply on al of them.
After which we check if the quantifiers makes any of the goals obsolete.

% The current ambiguity resolver i very simple. It just checks the number of
% possible interpretations. If we only have one it passes it through, otherwise
% it simply rejects the command.
