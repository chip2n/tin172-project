Together with Robin we created the first draft of the report for the first deadline.
I created test for the validation function which checks the laws of physics.
In this report I wrote the introduction, ambiguity resolver and the heuristics.
As of the code I also wrote the checks and heuristics for the A* function and was part of the creation of the ambiguity resolver
