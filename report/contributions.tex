Most of my work has gone into writing the Interpreter and functions related to the interpretation process.
A huge chunk of this work was focused on writing search functions for the objects (which took a long time to get right) and writing unit tests for every helper function in the interpreter.
The searching functions were relatively straightforward to both implement and write tests for (as mentioned in the report).
I managed to discover some bugs in the development doing this, though, so it was probably worth it.

I also worked along Johan and Sebastian to implement the Ambiguity Resolver. This implementation happened late in the development process, so it forced the group to rethink the goal representation a bit. Specifically, we needed to include the quantifiers in the goals, in order to separate "the" and "any" in the ambiguity resolver.

Furthermore, I participed in the group meetings, development sessions and discussion like any good boy would do, so I have a good grasp on the project as a whole.

Finally, I've written this contribution snippet. Yey!

Together with Robin we created the first draft of the report for the first deadline.

I created test for the validation function which checks the laws of physics.

In this report I wrote the introduction, ambiguity resolver and the heuristics.

As of the code I also wrote the checks and heuristics for the A* function and was part of the creation of the ambiguity resolver

Implemented the world validation.
How different objects are allowed to interact with each other and making sure no physical laws as defined in the project are violated.
Latex stuff
Code cleanup and documentation
