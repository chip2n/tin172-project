Most of my work has gone into writing the Interpreter and functions related to the interpretation process.
A huge chunk of this work was focused on writing search functions for the objects (which took a long time to get right) and writing unit tests for every helper function in the interpreter.
I managed to discover some bugs in the development doing this, though, so it was probably worth it.
I also worked along Johan and Sebastian to implement the Ambiguity Resolver. This implementation happened late in the development process, so it forced the group to rethink the goal representation a bit. Specifically, we needed to include the quantifiers in the goals, in order to separate "the" and "any" in the ambiguity resolver.
Furthermore, I participed in the group meetings, development sessions and discussion like any good boy would do, so I have a good grasp on the project as a whole.
Finally, I've written this contribution snippet. Yey!
