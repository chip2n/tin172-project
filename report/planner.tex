\section*{Planner}
Take utterence for specific objects.
Put utterence for spific objects on or inside specific objects.

\subsection*{Heuristics}
We started out by just implementing the ``take'' utterance, so our heuristics
were simply the number of objects on top of the sought-after object.  As we
continued to add more utterances, that part was left unchanged until we started
getting major speed issues. We long thought that this was an issue with our
state being too big, because we saved the whole world in every node of the
graph that the A* algorithm was searching through. After rewriting the graph
representation multiple times we realised that the problem was not with the
graph, but with the heuristics. The number of objects above a given object
turned out to be a very bad idea, and twice that number is much closer to
reality. This cut our search space down from 7000 nodes (basically bredth-first
search) to 40 nodes visited when picking up an object with about five objects
above it. More of our heuristics can be found in table~\ref{tab:heuristics}.

\begin{table}[h]
    \begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
    \hline
    Action        & Holding something & Heuristic                      \\ \hline
    Take          & Yes               & if holding the correct object: 0\\
                  &                   & otherwise: 2 + 2 *
                                        (number of objects above it)   \\ \hline
                  & No                & 1 + 2 * (number of objects
                                        above it)                      \\ \hline
    Move to floor & Yes               & This is too complicated        \\ \hline

\subsection*{A*}
Our implementation of the AStar algorithm.

%The planner is basically untouched as of yet. We have been working mostly on
%the interpreter and ambiguity resolver. It can currently only partially execute
%the take command. It can find the correct column where the requested object
%lies but only picks up the top object in that column.
