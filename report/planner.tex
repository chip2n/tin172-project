\section*{Planner}
Take utterence for specific objects.
Put utterence for spific objects on or inside specific objects.
Our own AStar-algorithm.

%The planner is basically untouched as of yet. We have been working mostly on
%the interpreter and ambiguity resolver. It can currently only partially execute
%the take command. It can find the correct column where the requested object
%lies but only picks up the top object in that column.
