\section*{Planner}
Take utterence for specific objects.
Put utterence for spific objects on or inside specific objects.

\subsection*{Heuristics}
We started out by just implementing the "take" utterance, so our heuristics
were simply the number of objects that were on top of the sought after object.
As we continued to add more utterances, that was left like that and later on it
caused problems. Our planner was running very slowly because it was searching
many more states that it did not have to, so picking up an object just a few
objects down caused a search through 7000 states - pretty much a bredth-first
search. This was solved by returning two times the number of objects above the
one searched for. Having found this, the search was cut down to 40 states.

\subsection*{A*}
Our own AStar-algorithm.

%The planner is basically untouched as of yet. We have been working mostly on
%the interpreter and ambiguity resolver. It can currently only partially execute
%the take command. It can find the correct column where the requested object
%lies but only picks up the top object in that column.
