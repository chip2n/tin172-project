\section*{Parser}
%Refactored the project and added a test which currently fails // Andreas
%instance Eq Size instead of deriving
The group started of by creating instances for Eq-class for the different types
such as Size, Color and Form. This was done to add the possiblity for the value
any- size, color or form and also to simplify the search process.
%The parser is currently unchanged. We intend to extend it with the negation
%command as mentioned below.
