\section*{Parser}
The input to the application is in the shape of a JSON string containing the world state, the user's utterance and other information that the interpreter and planner needs.
This string is sent from the web interface that was provided for us.

When the application receives the JSON string, it parses it into a bunch of useful data structures which we can later use in various parts of the application.
Much of this code was provided along with the web interface - we've only extended the parser with a few convenience functions for object comparisons and the parsing to specifig data structures like the world state and an object map which maps object ids to their corresponding descriptions.
